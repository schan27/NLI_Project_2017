even though joung people usually like enjoying themselves more than older people do , this is not necessarily true .for exemple , you could meet a really cool 60-years-old man that does everything in his power to have fun and make life worth of being lived , and a very boring 20-years-old boy who will never step out of his house except to go to school .on the other hand , iif it s true that joung people do enjoy life more , it could be because of the belief that one would better take advantage of its youth before it is too late .i do not totally agree with that statement , in fact i think that people should have the courage of enjoy their whole life , without wasting all their chances while they are just teenagers or waiting too long to start following their dreams .talking about real facts and people , i could nominate as many teens as older people that are enjoying their lifes .today s world offers chances to have fun to people of all ages : there are a lot of parks and resorts where a child can go and enjoy a few days and where its parents would have a great time too .holiday resorts where my grandparents would love to spend a few week can be found almost anywhere , and of course there are a lot of structures that offer amusement to teens between 15 and 30 years old .so , if a person wants to `` enjoy its life  , there is nothing keeping him from doing that .nevertheless , we will always meet someone who is not wanting to do any of these .and if we really pay attention to it , we will find out that this kind of behavior is present in people of all ages , there in not a real average .if one wants to have fuun , he will do it , and if he does nt he will not .maybe it s just another way of enjoying life , even though most people consider it boring and worthless .
