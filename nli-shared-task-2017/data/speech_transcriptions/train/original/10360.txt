The things I miss most when I'm away from home are first of all my family because uh they kind of represent everything to me. Number two is the place where I live. It is very sunny and I do miss the beaches and going round and having picnics with the people and enjoying time. Uh especially the beach where I do swim a lot. Uh and then comparing to where I'm staying in the United Kingdom is very cold at the moment. Uh another important thing is cooking. I really do miss uh my kind of family cooking at home um.
